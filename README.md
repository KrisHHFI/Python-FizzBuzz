# Python FizzBuzz Program

### About

- A very basic FizzBuzz program
- The program iterates through the numbers 1 to a 100
- If the number is a multiple of 3 then "Fizz" is printed, if its a multiple of 5 "Buzz" is printed and if its a multiple of both "Fizz Buzz" is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, then the number itself is printed
- Part of a series of FizzBuzz programs I have posted, all of which are following the same logic

### Run the program

- Install Python on your computer
- Download the FizzBuzz.py file
- Navigate to the file and execute: python FizzBuzz.py
